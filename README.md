# IsTyping...
A simple Bash script to simulate "is typing..." in Telegram(desktop)

I write a blog post in Farsi about this script, [here](https://sadraa.me/40linebash/)

First install xdotool
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xdotool
 ```
Then clone or download the repo and make sure Telgram desktop is open.

Run:
```
cd IsTyping/
./IsTyping
```

Here, I chat with myself :) and as you can see "Is Typing..." is working.

Hooray :) !
